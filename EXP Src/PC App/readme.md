# Usage

The app needs to be running on a computer thats on the same network as the Type-D Telemetry unit. Once detected the stast will auto fill.

The original python script will be in the script folder in this directory

## Features

* Live telemetry dashboard: Fan %, CPU temp, Ambient temp, and Current App in an OG Xbox–styled UI.

* Graph mode: grid background, yellow “current” dot, floating value label, min/max/current readouts, and °C/°F toggle.

* Extended console status: Tray state, AV pack type (robust decode), PIC version, encoder (Conexant/Focus/Xcalibur), and video resolution with 480i/p, 576i/p, 720p, 1080i inference.

* Xbox version detection: prefers EEPROM serial mapping; falls back to encoder family; finally uses SMC code if available.

* EEPROM panel: shows Serial, MAC, Region, and HDD key* (masked with “Reveal” toggle); resilient parsing from raw 256-byte dump with fallback layouts.

* Time-windowed history: charts keep a fixed wall-time window (configurable; default ~10 minutes), independent of packet rate.

* Compatibility: accepts multiple EEPROM message formats and any field order for encoder/width/height; tolerates missing or partial data.

* Theming & polish: consistent Xbox-green palette, beveled 7-segment displays, compact single-window layout.
  
*HDD feature is still being worked on and may not produce an actual key
